# YetAnotherSoccerDatabase

## To-Do List
* Matches Page
** Lineups for a match
** Be able to search by a team or a specific match-up (i.e. Manchester United vs. Liverpool)
* Update this file with the used languages and how to setup the website locally.
* Write up of week-by-week assignments, what I've done, lessons learned, technologies used, etc.

## Setup

Install dependencies for the server and client: `npm i && cd client && npm i`

Start up a local instance of the server: `npm server`

Start up a local instance of the web client: `npm client`

Or both: `npm start`

## Libraries/Languages
**TODO:** Explain what each library/language is used for.

### Data Source
The backing data source is a Soccer API called [Sports Monks](https://www.sportmonks.com). They have country, competition, club, and player information from 1992 onward. Their dataset also includes scores from fixtures during that period, but only has in-depth fixture statistics (shots-on-target, passing, etc.) for the past two seasons. Because of this difference in available data, I've only retrieved fixture information for the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons.

The ETL process was implemented in Python, and can be viewed under `scripts/sports_monks.py`.

### Local Database
The local database, using the MySQL DBMS, almost mirrors the dataset retrieved by Sports Monks. However, due to missing/optional information about some clubs, competitions, and players, some of the data in the local database has been calculated. For example, the PlayerSeason table has been generated by joining the Player and PlayerGame tables and grouping by player, competition, and club.

The Relation Schema, modelled as the MySQL create table statements, can be viewed under `configuration/sports_monks_db.sql`.

### Back End Server
* Node
* Express


### Front End Web App
* React
* React Router
* Bootstrap


## Deprecated Scripts/Files
I previously attempted to retrieve information from two other websites before I moved to the Sports Monks API. The ETL scripts and relational schema files can be seen in the `deprecated/` folder, which has been kept for historical longevity, even though the scripts and .sql files are unused.

### [FBRef.com](https://fbref.com) (`deprecated/fbref`)
The Sports-Reference website is in the process of creating a website for soccer statistics. However, at the time of writing, their website is only partially developed and is not guaranteed to be accurate. Unfortunately, I learned that their data was inaccurate after having already created and fully run the script used to scrape data from their website.

### [Football Lineups](www.football-lineups.com) (`deprecated/football-lineups`)
